@############Computer Science vs Computer Engineering :: Roles and Responsibilities##################
One strategy for determining whih path is right for you is to consider your career goals. for instance, if you are looking to work in cybersecurity or as a systems administrator, computer science may be a giid fit for . if your goal is to eventually becomes a software architect or developer, a degree in computer science or computer engineering will equip you gor the job. Advanced computer science curricula thoroughly cover how networks and systems security protocols work while teaching programming and appropriate mathematics concepts. 
Computer scientists typicallly have an understanding of:::: programming languages such as Java, SQL, and Python; how to run. maintain . and fix Linux and Windows operating sustems; data structures and algorithms;
basics cybersecurity and cryptography;
knowledge of designing , coding, and testing software;
how computer networks work and how to manage them.
@###$%%^&&& Some common skills a computer engineer utilize include::::::
A computer understanding og how computer hardware and architect works;
Knowledge of designing. coding, and testing software ;
flecibility to work with a wide range of software, which can be highly specialized depending on the company and /or industry;
ability to build your own PC systems and repair/ maintain device drivers......
