unit of concentration

mass of NaoH = 10g
Volume of solution = 1 litre
Molarity of NaoH = M = ?
Mass of NaOH = 23+16+1
       Na,O,H = 40g mol inverse 1 (-1)

*Molarity = No .of Moles of solution/Nolume of solution
No of moles = mass / molar mass

*****Mole Fraction**********
A        B
nA  +    nB
Mole Fraction of A  = No of mole of A ? Total No of Moles
                    = nA /  nA + nB
Mole Fraction of B  = No of mole of B /Total no of momomole
                    = nA /  nA + nB
Example of Mole Fraction :- 
girls    + 10
boys = 2o
mole fraction of girls = 10 /3 

mole fraction of girls = 10 / 30
 = 0.33
mole fraction of boys = 20  / 30 
  = 0.66

********* mass % or Weight % (w/w %)
mass % = mass of solute / mass of solute * 100
     = 6 / 66 * 100
     =9.09

mass of solution = 6
mass of solution = mass of solute
    = 6 + 66 
   = 66
