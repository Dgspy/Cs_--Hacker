Polonium : -
polonium is a most dangerous element when we consume that element ,it break your cell your cells get sucide and you will died.
(2) this element is no smell and test
(3) it go into the lungs and convert a oxygen in single element ,oxygen get mlargely point out to the wall of the lungs and the cell of the body get collapes then the people get died .

copper :-
the copper ^ atomic no is 29 and mass is 63
copper is good for the health we can drink water from copper bottle and also eat a food in copper plate it is usefull and good metal
*but all in the world that say every things is dont consume at a limit
*copper limit is 1000 MCS
                 copper = cuprum(CU)
                 limit = 1000 MCS
*when we consume the copper than it's limit then we get tired feel and sweetness are start and finally you get death

sodium and potassium :-
* a sodium and a potassium is the enemy of the hydrogen means a water when we eat a potassium +sodium it stick on the toung and also go in the stomack it get stomachach
*sodium is dangerous ,it causes for the heart attack
*scientest say that " ate a salt as your need" because the sodiun is cause to heart attack.

Arsenic :- it is almost confuse it self because its dose not no ,he is metal or nonmetal
*its ia not a good conductor of the electricity
If arsenic poisoning occurs over a brief period of time, symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, and watery diarrhea that contains blood.

lead :-
*Lead is a cumulative toxicant that affects multiple body systems and is particularly harmful to young children.
*Lead in the body is distributed to the brain, liver, kidney and bones. It is stored in the teeth and bones, where it accumulates over time. Human exposure is usually assessed through the measurement of lead in blood.
*Lead in bone is released into blood during pregnancy and becomes a source of exposure to the developing fetus.
*There is no level of exposure to lead that is known to be without harmful effects.
*Lead exposure is preventable.

fluorine :-
*Fluoride toxicity is a condition in which there are elevated levels of the fluoride ion in the body. Although fluoride is safe for dental health at low concentrations, sustained consumption of large amounts of soluble fluoride salts is dangerous. Referring to a common salt of fluoride, sodium fluoride (NaF), the lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10 g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64 mg elemental fluoride/kg body weight).[1][2][3] Ingestion of fluoride can produce gastrointestinal discomfort at doses at least 15 to 20 times lower (0.2â€“0.3 mg/kg or 10 to 15 mg for a 50 kg person) than lethal doses.[4] Although it is helpful topically for dental health in low dosage, chronic ingestion of fluoride in large amounts interferes with bone formation. In this way, the most widespread examples of fluoride poisoning arise from consumption of ground water that is abnormally fluoride-rich.

sulphur :-
* sulphur is the less toxic element
* it is include in a vegetables
* sulphur is the less toxic element
