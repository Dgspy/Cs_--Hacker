######Very Nice Defination of time#############
 time is slow when you wait !!!
 time is fast when you are late!!!1
time is deadly when you are late !!!
time is short when you are happy 

time is endless when you are in pain !!1
time is long when you feed bored !!
every time, time is determined by your 
feeling and your psychological condtion 
and not by clocks...
      so have a noce time always.............
